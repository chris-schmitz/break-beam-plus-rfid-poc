# I have no idea what I'm doing

That's not completely true, but I'm def still pretty new to C++, micro controllers, planning circuits, electronics, etc.

Also, I find it's eaiser to work on a project by isolating concepts and tasks into proofs of concepts and then fitting them together into prototypes while I figure out how the final project is going to work.

So, this folder contains a bunch of pocs and prototypes I'm using to learn concepts, figure out how to make things work, and then assemble it all together.

The final prototypes I'm working from that will eventually inform the final version of the code are:

-   peg-prototype
-   plinko-prototype

So those are prob the best places to start if you're browsing around.
